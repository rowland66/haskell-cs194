Solutions to UPenn CS194 Introduction To Haskell Homework Assignments

This repository contains my solutions to a number of the homework assignments from the University of Pennsylvania computer science class [CS194 Introduction to Haskell, Spring 2013](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/%7Ecis194/spring13/).

For some of the assignments, I have gone a bit beyond what was required. Each assignment has a readme file of its own that describes any extensions.
